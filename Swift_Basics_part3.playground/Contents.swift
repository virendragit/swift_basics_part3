//Basic Operators

/*
 Terminology
 
 Operators are unary, binary, Or ternary:
 -> Unary operators operate on a sigle target (such as -a)
 
 -> Binary operators operate on two targets (Such 2 + 3)
 
 -> ternary condition (a ? b : c).
 
 The value that Operators affect are operands. In the expression 1 + 2 , the + symbol is a binary opeator
 and its two operands are the value 1 and 2.

//Assignment Operator

/*
 The assignment operator (a = b) initializes or updates the value of a with the value of b :
 */

let b = 4

var a = -9

let reminder = (a % b)

a =  b // a is now equal to 10


//let (x, y) = (1, 2)

// Unlike the assginment operator in C and Objective-C, The assigment opertor in swift does not itself retun a value.


//Below is not a valid stmt, Because x = y does not return a value.
/*
if x = y {
    
}
 */

//"hello, " + "world"

//Remainder Operator

let reminder = (a % b)
